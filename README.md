This project is meant as a means of learning how to code more complex programs with data structures, as well as teaching myself how to code in an organized way.
The main goal of this project is not to nessecarily use the most logical data structures, but to practice with all different kinds of them.  Thus, there might be
better methods of going about what the project does, but I am not trying to achieve the best possible solution.  Rather, I want to experiment with differnet methods to 
expand my knowledge.
